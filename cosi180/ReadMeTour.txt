Part 2A

I implemented Prim using the adjaceny list for the graph. I made the heap/dictionary structure more general so it can now be used to do operations on both vertices (time/distance from origin to vertex) and edges (edge weight).

OutputPrim.txt is a tour using Prim's algorithm. The tour begining at T takes 292 legs and 15.9 miles.

I'm not aware of any bugs in the Prim methods

2B

I implemented a simple triangle algorithm which reduced distance slightly to 289 legs in 15.7 miles.
